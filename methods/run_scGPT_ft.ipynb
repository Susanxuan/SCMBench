    "# Fine-tuning on Pre-trained Model for Multiomic Integration\n",
    "In this tutorial, we demonstrate how to fine-tune a pre-trained model for multiomic integration. We use the BMMC dataset as an example for RNA and protein abundance data integration from CITE-seq. The BMMC dataset consists of multiple batches by donor origin. In the paired integration setting, each cell contains both RNA and protein measurements. We fine-tune on the pre-trained whole-body model.\n",
    "\n",
    "We summarize the fine-tuning pipeline in the following steps, which can be used as a general recipe for finetuning on integration tasks and beyond: \n",
