## Preprocessing

Codes for preprocessing of the datasets, including feature selection and sampling, unimodal representation, and calculation of the activity matrix. 

Before you start, please download and place the datasets under `download/`.


We provide the jupyter notebook for feature selection and sampling, python script for unimodal representation, and calculation of the activity matrix in `preprocessing/` and the corresponding example shell script for running.
